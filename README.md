===========

My MSP430 lib


* Useful JSON creating, parsing and dumping tool's to make mcu exchange data with high-level programming language interface more easily.

* PWM object makes PWM settings simple, with SPWM data preseted.

* Easy to use Timer setting and callbacks, support many events in various overflow * periods

* Useful binary-ascii tools: CRC32, CRC16, base64(encode).

* Code effecient and easy to use "qprint.c" printf implementation, working with UART interface profiles.

* a tiny pinosc implementation (on working).
